# Head-First-Java


#The main intention of this repository is to store all the exercises I did during  my reading of  Head First Java 2nd Edition: https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/head-first-java/0596009208/

#Note: In order to really learn the concepts of Java  the book recommended not to use any IDE osuch as Eclipse or NetBeans so I #used a text editor. In my case Gedit since I have RedHat in my Desktop.
